Please follow the instructions in the word document for setting up the environment 

We need a new Azure Resource Group created.
- Deploy in the new Resource Group a vNet (a /24 CIDR sized subnet) and a SQL PaaS Database.
- We want the SQL PaaS database to be connected by the vNet only and not accessible via the internet.
